The English Wikipedia is the English-language edition of the free online encyclopedia Wikipedia. Founded on 15 January 2001 and reaching four million articles by July 2012, it was the first edition of Wikipedia and, as of September 2014, has the most articles (more than twice as many as the next in rank, the Swedish Wikipedia). As of June 2015, nearly 13.9% of articles in all Wikipedias belong to the English-language edition. This share has gradually declined from more than 50 percent in 2003, due to the growth of Wikipedias in other languages. There are 4,885,457 articles on the site (live count). In December 2012, the combined text of the English Wikipedia's articles totaled roughly 9.7 gigabytes.
